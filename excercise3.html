                <h3>Biography</h3>
                <p>Rocket League was first released for Playstation and Xbox consoles in July 7, 2015. Despite being released in 2015,
                    it's highly popular to this date and played concurrently by an average of 900,000 players each day. Rocket
                    League is known for being a competive game especially because it's an e-sport game. There are professional teams out there 
                    that train and compete in tournaments for prize money and bragging rights. It's a very unique game because pro players
                    continually keep improving and finding new in game mechanics to make themselves and their teams better.
                    Rocket League is such a unique game because of the ability to continue to improve your abilities and for that reason
                    I don't see this game dying anytime soon.
